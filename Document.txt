This file was prepared for attendees of the workshop at PIL.

List of contents:

1. Information
  
  	This session is more of a simulation of a team. There is the main file that everyone will work on - 'Document.txt'.
	Attendees will be divided into groups with 2-3 people and each group will work on that file.
	Each group will have instructions what to do. What we want to achieve is:
		- people will see how to clone files from repo
		- often commits
		- pushes/pulls
		- pull request
		- what happens when someone updates their version, request a pull, therefore, changes the master file
